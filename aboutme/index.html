    <h2>Eric Benge</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Eric, and I am from Vienna, Austria.
    I am taking this course to get a bachelor's degree in Applied Technology.
    My hobbies are martial arts, specifically filipino martial arts. I also like to read and play video games. I served in the South Africa Durban Mission for eight months, and served the rest of my time in the Alpine German Speaking Mission, most of it in Switzerland.</p>
    <p>I am currently engaged and will get married next August. The reason I am pursuing a career in web-developement and programming is because I enjoy doing it, and it is something I can see myself doing to provide for my family</p>
